The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N
non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
This is a program that solves the N queens problem.

def is_safe(board, row, col):
    """
    Check if it's safe to place a queen at the position board[row][col].

    This function checks if placing a queen at the given position (row, col)
    is safe from any attacks by other queens already placed on the board.
    Specifically, it ensures that no other queen is in:
    1. The same column.
    2. The same upper-left diagonal.
    3. The same upper-right diagonal.

    Parameters:
    - board (list of list of int): The 2D list representing the chessboard,
      where 1 indicates a queen and 0 indicates an empty space.
    - row (int): The row index where we want to place the queen.
    - col (int): The column index where we want to place the queen.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if it is safe to place a queen at (row, col), otherwise False.

    Solve the N Queens problem using backtracking.

    Function uses a backtracking algorithm to place queens on the chessboard
    in a way that no two queens threaten each other. It explores all possible
    placements of queens row by row, and if it finds a valid configuration,
    it adds it to the solutions list.

    Parameters:
    - board (list of list of int): The 2D list representing the chessboard,
      where 1 indicates a queen and 0 indicates an empty space.
    - row (int): The current row index where we are trying to place a queen.
    - solutions (list of list of list of int): A list where each element is a
      valid solution (a list of queen positions) to the N Queens problem.
